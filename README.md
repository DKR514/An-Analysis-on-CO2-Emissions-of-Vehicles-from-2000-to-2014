The following report is a thorough analysis of CO2 emissions produced by cars and various features of a car that bolster the effects of its production. This report is mandated by the Ministry of Environment XYZ in order to help analyze and provide recommendations for the reduction of CO2 emissions of cars. We firstly analyzed the data using descriptive analytics and preliminary analysis, then we dive into modeling to reinforce these analyses, and lastly provide recommendations as a result. We aimed to answer 5 key business questions in our analysis:
What are different characteristics of cars that increase or decrease the rate of CO2 production?
Does the size of the engine play a determinant role on the CO2 emissions amount?
What are the top 3 classes of engines that we should stop producing to preserve the environment?
Top 3 ecological model engines which produce the lowest CO2 emissions between 2010 and 2014?
Top 5 brands which produce engines with low CO2 and can be recommended to the public?
We were able to conclude that major components and features of the car which include engine size, number of cylinders, model year and various fuel consumptions on various roads contributed to a significant increase in CO2 emissions. As recommendations, we recommend that buyers avoid the Chevrolet brand and lean toward Volkswagen. We also recommend the buyer to be conscious of the mentioned features that are heavy contributors to car CO2 emissions. Lastly, in regards to the Ministry of Environment, we recommend the continued investment in R&D and public awareness.
